# Econsim
## *A Testbed Project on Statistical Macroeconomic Simulation for Optimal Policy Learning in Decision Intelligence Systems*

**Description:**  
Econsim is an exploratory sandbox for experimenting with macroeconomic modeling and deep reinforcement learning, focused on simplified applications like business inventory management and product pricing. It is a testbed for developing accurate statistical simulation approaches for training and testing Reinforcement learning agents in macro-economic systems.

**Purpose:**  
- Prototype early simulation environments and statistical modeling techniques  
- Deepen understanding of statistical frameworks for economic decision systems  
- Build a foundation for macroeconomic policy modeling  
- Identify limitations and challenges in current simulation-based methods  
- Lay groundwork for training effective macroeconomic policy agents

**Summary:**  
This paper delves into the intersection of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and macroeconomics, highlighting its potential in optimal policy-making, game theory, and modeling bounded rationality. It provides an accessible introduction to DRL algorithms and discusses their applications in macroeconomic modeling, including both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios. The authors also address the challenges and limitations of DRL in this field, offering insights into future research directions.
